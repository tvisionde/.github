# TVDesktop

**T**urbo **V**ision **Desktop** is a proof-of-concept (POC) desktop environment that instead uses a window compositor+GUI it uses TUI.

This was made inspired on Borland's Turbo Vision demo.

# Repositories

* TVDesktop: the main project

* libtvdesktop: library for external applications that wants to be in TVDesktop (since it's not GUI, though) and the desktop itself.
